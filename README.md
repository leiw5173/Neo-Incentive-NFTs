# Neo Incentive NFTs

This project shows the whole structure of Neo NFT incentive system. We utilize a Demo to develop to MVP to validate the feasibility of this system. This proposal includes several terms:

- Tutorial example
- Tasks based on tutorial
- NFT series based on Tasks
- Claim method
- Feedback and improvement ways

## Tutorial example

We will use [A Demo of Neo N3 Core Components dApp](https://github.com/leiw5173/A-Demo-of-Neo-N3-Core-Components-dApp) as tutorial example. The dApp built in it is designed for the following usage scenario:

_Oliver_ is looking for an accommodation. To make the reservation, the dApp requires Oliver to identify himself as an individual. Fortunately for Oliver, his Government has recently decided to implement a digital version of the national ID with the help of the Neo blockchain. Oliver needs to apply for a digital ID by presenting his physical ID to a local authority. At the moment of booking, Oliver can identify himself to the dApp with his digital Passport. Once the identity is verified, the dApp issues an access key credential to Oliver. Among the other things, the access key contains a code that gives access to an automatic door to enter the accommodation. When Oliver arrives at his accommodation, he displays the booking confirmation to the Door Lock, an automatic door with a IoT device capable to verify Oliver's claim. Once the booking is verified, Oliver is finally able to enter the accommodation.

In this tutorial, it describes an interactive demo to demonstrate the functionality and usage of NeoID (Neo Identity) as well as Neo Oracle and NeoFS (Neo File Storage) with an example use case.

In this tutorial, the structure is shown as below:

- Environment setting
- Smart contract writing
  - Basic smart contract knowledge
  - Oracle integration
- Smart contract compiling, deployment, Invokation, and testing
- Neo dApp and smart contract interaction
- NeoID integration
- NeoFS integration
- Demo operation

According to this structure, we will seperate the tutorial into 8 courses. For each course, it will last around 60 minutes.

## Tasks based on tutorial

The tasks are designed according to the structure of tutorial. 7 serieses of tasks will be set to test the first 7 learning processes. The last one demonstrate the whole procedure of this dapp. The serieses of tasks are shown as below:

- Set environment to fetch the data of Neo testnet
- Deploy a smart contract on N3 testnet
- Update the smart contract with Oracle integration
- Invoke and debug a smart contract with [NeoExpress and NeoTrace](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express)
- Develop a frontend page to interact with smart contract
- Update the smart contract and frontend page to integrate with NeoID
- Update the smart contract and frontend page to integrate with NeoFS

After the tasks finished by learners, we need methods to check their degrees of different tasks' completion. The method can be set as below:

- Submit the screenshot of the fetched data
- Submit the contract hash
- Submit the contract hash after update
- Submit the NeoExpress file and NeoTrace file
- Submit the website address
- Submit the contract hash and frontend page after update
- Submit the contract hash and frontend page after update

In this segment, we set up the tasks and checking point and make sure the learners get familiar with the whole development process of Neo N3.
