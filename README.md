# Neo Incentive NFTs

This project shows the whole structure of Neo NFT incentive system. We utilize a Demo to develop to MVP to validate the feasibility of this system. This proposal includes several terms:

- Tutorial example
- Tasks based on tutorial
- NFT series based on Tasks
- Claim method
- Feedback and improvement ways

## Tutorial example

We will use [A Demo of Neo N3 Core Components dApp](https://github.com/leiw5173/A-Demo-of-Neo-N3-Core-Components-dApp) as tutorial example. The dApp built in it is designed for the following usage scenario:
_Oliver_ is looking for an accommodation. To make the reservation, the dApp requires Oliver to identify himself as an individual. Fortunately for Oliver, his Government has recently decided to implement a digital version of the national ID with the help of the Neo blockchain. Oliver needs to apply for a digital ID by presenting his physical ID to a local authority. At the moment of booking, Oliver can identify himself to the dApp with his digital Passport. Once the identity is verified, the dApp issues an access key credential to Oliver. Among the other things, the access key contains a code that gives access to an automatic door to enter the accommodation. When Oliver arrives at his accommodation, he displays the booking confirmation to the Door Lock, an automatic door with a IoT device capable to verify Oliver's claim. Once the booking is verified, Oliver is finally able to enter the accommodation.
In this tutorial, it describes an interactive demo to demonstrate the functionality and usage of NeoID (Neo Identity) as well as Neo Oracle and NeoFS (Neo File Storage) with an example use case.
